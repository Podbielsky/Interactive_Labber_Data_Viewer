TODO list for next versions:

 - re-write more parts of the code either in cython or fortran, but test windows handling beforehand
   - think about installation handling if no matching compiler for cython or fortran could be found

- add snr calc for multi parameter maps based on bimodal gaussian distribution (IMPORTANT)
    - should be easier than the point before, but you have to think about how the data structure is handled

- deprecate histogram map function and add functionality of plotting histogram map to trace plotter class (part of SNR)
 (also clean up HDF5Data class)

- implement a knew tool to plot time trace maps

- variable range plotting for dedicated areas

- rescaling of line-plots in the line-cut section should be improved to get better visibility

- add possibility to create .hdf5 data which can be read in by the script from .npy data or other structured array data

(maybe add functionality to plot single traces and perform fits on them, should be done after .npy read-in works.
 Should include mulit column read in for hdf5 data and multi-trace selection.
  Implementation should be a new line plotting class which would also be used in line-cuts)

- low priority: implement multithreading for i/o and calculation to create a smoother experience


- BUG: if you switch to the relation parameter menu, the apply button vanishes for subsequent uses of different BG-sub.
methods -> not urgent but would be nice to fix this

- BUG (at least on Windows): Relation parameters do not work after it was once applied and another dataset is loaded in
