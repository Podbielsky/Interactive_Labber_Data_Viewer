TODO list for next versions:

- add snr calc for multi parameter maps based on bimodal gaussian distribution
    - should be easier than the point before, but you have to think about how the data structure is handled

- deprecate histogram map function and add functionality of plotting histogram map to trace plotter class (part of SNR)
 (also clean up HDF5Data class)

- implement a new tool to plot time trace maps

- implement external traces

- variable range plotting for dedicated areas

- rescaling of line-plots in the line-cut section should be improved to get better visibility

- implement first/last few line average subtraction

- implement fourier filter

- implement removal of meta-data for whole directory

(maybe add functionality to plot single traces and perform fits on them, should be done after .npy read-in works.
 Should include mulit column read in for hdf5 data and multi-trace selection.
  Implementation should be a new line plotting class which would also be used in line-cuts)

- low priority: implement multithreading for i/o and calculation to create a smoother experience

- BUG: if you switch to the relation parameter menu, the apply button vanishes for subsequent uses of different BG-sub.
methods -> not urgent but would be nice to fix this

- BUG (at least on Windows): Relation parameters do not work after it was once applied and another dataset is loaded in

- BUG Installation does not work on certain Windows desktops (no clue why)
