TODO list for next versions:

- add snr calc for multi parameter maps based on bimodal gaussian distribution
    - should be easier than the point before, but you have to think about how the data structure is handled

- deprecate histogram map function and add functionality of plotting histogram map to trace plotter class (part of SNR)
 (also clean up HDF5Data class)

- implement a new tool to plot time trace maps

- implement external traces

- rescaling of line-plots in the line-cut section should be improved to get better visibility

- implement fourier filter

-maybe add functionality to plot single traces and perform fits on them, should be done after .npy read-in works.
 Should include mulit column read in for hdf5 data and multi-trace selection.
  Implementation should be a new line plotting class which would also be used in line-cuts

- low priority: implement multithreading for i/o and calculation to create a smoother experience

- BUG Installation does not work on certain Windows desktops (no clue why, probably to not activating the venv and
 using the default system PATH)
