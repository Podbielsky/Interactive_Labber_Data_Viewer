TODO list for next versions:
- add rate or mean level time calculation and display to functionalities for data with traces (IMPORTANT)
  - numba will be needed to make it faster as first implementation should be Luccas code (not compatible :P )
  - re-write more parts of the code either in cython or fortran, but test windows handling beforehand
    - think about installation handling if no matching compiler for cython or fortran could be found
- add snr calc for multi parameter maps based on bimodal gaussian distribution (IMPORTANT)
  - should be easier than the point before, but you have to think about how the data structure is handled
- deprecate histogram map function and add functionality of plotting histogram map to trace plotter class (part of SNR)
-? should the calculation of the histogram be done in the HDF5data class or the plotting tool ?
- variable range plotting for dedicated areas
- rescaling of line-plots in the line-cut section should be improved to get better visibility
(maybe add pastel color scheme if dependecies are not to heavy and current version of matplotlib allows for it)
(maybe add functionality to read in .npy files with .json file as parameters,
 has to be derived class from hdf5 data class)
(maybe add functionality to plot single traces and perform fits on them, should be done after .npy read-in works.
 Should include mulit column read in for hdf5 data and multi-trace selection.
  Implementation should be a new line plotting class which would also be used in line-cuts)
