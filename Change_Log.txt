changes in v0.4.3:
- implemented new method in HDF5Data for fast data access  of traces via reference
- looking at map with traces does not create a wdir folder with all traces
- saving traces in wdir as numpy arrays is now possible via file menu in the hdf5 overview window
- trace plots under an array are now given a title which specifies their position in the array
- trace plots have now x and y label as class attribute
- included update plot button so colormaps can be changed without resetting further modification (e.g derivatives)
- allow for selected traces to be saved within data menu of the interactive plotter
- included 2d fft on displayed data

changes in v0.4.3a
- included histogram option for time traces
- included polynomial background subtraction
- include median difference background correction

changes in v0.4.4
- bug fix of saving file as .pdf format introducing false raster
- bug fix for coral draw read-in of .pdf files
- removed deprecated histogram map and time trace map plotting as standalone functions from the main .hdf5 file menu
  (functionalities of those functions are taken over by map plot with traces)
- added python file for custom colormaps
- added new cyclic colormap NeonPiCy
- included scaling of displayed data
- aborted measurements can now be displayed
- included background subtraction by relation parameters
- moved derivative and 2d fft to new sub menu called "Tools"
- added tool which allows to draw in arbitrary lines and tells starting and end position


change in v0.4.5
- invert button now also works with update plot
- the start and coordinates of the lines are now rounded to the 6 digit
- added line-wise mean correction
- gradient now uses mean spacing of x and y coordinates do estimate the real gradient and not only the second order difference
- added the possibility to create reduced data sets from the original .hdf5 data
- implemented calculation and plotting of tunnel rates of data, which contains time traces
- implemented creation of compatible .hdf5 files from numpy files containing 2D-arrays
